      <p id="introduction" className="page-hook">Your knowledge predicts the problems you get to solve.</p>
      <p className="page-promise">
        Knowledge refers to the three forms of competence: <strong>works</strong> (what you&rsquo;ve made), <strong>skills</strong> (what you can do), and <strong>education</strong> (what you know). Your knowledge predicts your problems: which ones you are trusted with.

      <p>
        Schooling is issued; skills and works are earned, never finished. Each is best measured by what can be checked: shipped <WikiLink href="#works">work</WikiLink>, demonstrated <WikiLink href="#skills">skill</WikiLink>, a dated <WikiLink href="#education">curriculum</WikiLink>. Mastery is turning study into practice, and practice into shipped work.

        What you have made is a function of <strong>employment</strong> (given) and <strong>authorship</strong> (chosen), the two best predictors of what you are trusted to build next. Mine: two methodologies, one for learning, one for teaching, and the programs built with them.

      <h2 id="skills">Skills <span className="heading-paren">(Practice)</span></h2>
      <p>
        What you can do is a function of <strong>technical</strong> skill (trained) and <strong>interpersonal</strong> skill (earned), the two best predictors of what you deliver alone and through others. Mine: organizing knowledge, designing systems, producing content, teaching anything.

      <NestedTable {...SKILLS} />

      <h2 id="education">Education <span className="heading-paren">(Theory)</span></h2>
      <p>
        What you know is a function of <strong>schooling</strong> (issued) and <strong>curriculum</strong> (chosen), the two best predictors of how fast you learn the next domain. Mine: seven grades of school, Mandarin to distinction, enrollment only when a domain demands it.
