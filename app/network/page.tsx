// Network in three branches — the three vectors of every human relationship:
// Nurture (take — the people who give the organism what it needs, when it
// needs it), Progress (share — the people beside me), Contribution (give — the
// people who depend on me). Two bands per branch, per the site standard:
// personal and professional. Categories are named for the page each
// relationship serves (Story, Lifestyle, Knowledge, Health, Wealth) with the
// role class in the gloss. Rows are ROLES ordered by need — each appears in
// the order life requires it, the next hire triggered by getting busier or
// richer — so band counts count relationship types. Each role's value is its
// benchmark: the four A's for people (available, able, affective, advocating)
// shading into the three C's for services (consistent, comprehensive,
// current) as encounters thin. The holder hangs beneath as an unlabelled
// child. Two statuses: "Pending" marks a role whose holder will be published
// and linked once the contact is made; "Private" marks a role held or to be
// held whose details stay unpublished by design — private individuals,
// protected relationships, confidential rooms. Kept deliberately minimal: standing relationships only —
// once-off and referral-reachable experts live in the private plans, not the
// map. Named people appear only in professional capacity or with standing
// consent. Benchmarks marked "Pending" refine band by band.
