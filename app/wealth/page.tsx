// statement), Growth (allocate what remains, investments before ventures).

// worth, holdings — are deliberately excluded site-wide; this page publishes
// the system and the benchmarks it runs against, not the account values.
// Primary metrics carry the benchmark; constituents hang indented beneath

        Unlike the other status pages, this one publishes no readings. Balances, net
        worth, and holdings are excluded from the site by design; what is public is the
        system itself — every account the money moves through, and the benchmark each is
        held to. The structure is auditable even where the numbers are private.

        The floor under everything else, in two registers: the losses I have transferred
        to insurers (insurance) and the earning that funds the whole system (income).
        Cover is bought against capacity first and possessions second, and income is
        priced actively by the hour until ownership can pay instead.

        The income statement of a life, in two registers: what running it costs
        (expenses) and what must be settled with lenders, the state, and the future
        (payments). The cascade is fixed — expenses under 35% of gross, tax under
        15%, so at least half of every dollar flows on to payments, savings, and
        investment. The savings margin is the number the rest exist to protect.

        Where the savings margin goes, in two registers: the standing portfolio filled
        as a waterfall — liquidity, then retirement, then rewards, then the hedge, then
        education (investments) — and the active positions taken only once every level
        is full (ventures). Each level is a grade of financial development, and the
        hierarchy is the discipline: nothing ventures until everything is invested.
