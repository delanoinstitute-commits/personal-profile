// A life read as a causal chain in three branches, assigned by when a fact
// became true: Inheritance (true at the instant of birth, no response possible),
// Development (administered over time, a response possible), Emergence (chosen
// against what the first two predicted). Every table runs exactly two bands,
// the site-wide taxonomy standard; Inheritance splits on transmission — down a
// germline (biological) or with a birth certificate (social). Development marks
// lived stages "Record" and unlived ones "Intent" so a plan is never mistaken
// for a fact. Genotype values are read from the raw 23andMe v5 export
// (631,991 markers, February 2022); ancestry from the 23andMe composition
// report (November 2025). The retired prose and era timeline live in git
// history and content/timeline.tsx.

      <p className="page-promise">
        From my DNA and family tree to every stage of life so far: the whole timeline
        is here, including the parts that were handed to me and the choices nothing
        about them predicted.
      </p>
      <p>
        It reads in three branches: <WikiLink href="#inheritance">inheritance</WikiLink>{" "}
        (what arrived before I could choose), <WikiLink href="#development">development</WikiLink>{" "}
        (what shaped me while I grew), and <WikiLink href="#emergence">emergence</WikiLink>{" "}
        (what I chose for myself). Each fact sits where its timing puts it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lived years carry records; future ones carry plans, and I never confuse the
        two. Most of a life belongs to the first two branches — the interesting part
        is how small the third is, and how much it changes.
